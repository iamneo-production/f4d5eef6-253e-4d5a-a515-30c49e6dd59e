Hi!
The integration for all the pages is still not complete.
To register a user uncomment the <UserRegistration/> component in App.js
To register a user uncomment the <AdminRegistration/> component in App.js
To login with the new user or admin got to ./ApiCalls/UserDashboard.js or ./ApiCalls/AdminDashboard.js and change the username and password with any registered user
or admin.
Click on the navigation Links for furthur usage.
The backend is completly inetegrated. Using postman or any other api endpoint checker, the endpoints can be checked
Password for superadmin is '1234' and email is 'super@gmail.com'
You can check this out by going to ./ApiCalls/SuperAminDashboard.js
